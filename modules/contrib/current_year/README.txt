CONFIGURATION

Choose a text format that you want to be able to display the current year.
In the list of Enabled Filters for that format, check "Current Year". If
necessary, rearrange the Filter Processing Order to avoid problems.

To see the current year in formatted text, ensure the text uses a format that
has this filter enabled. Simply type the token "&year;" wherever you'd like
to see the current year displayed.
